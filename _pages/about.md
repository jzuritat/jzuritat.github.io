Hi, I’m José Zurita-Tapia — a political scientist from Ecuador, currently pursuing a PhD in Comparative Politics at the University of Bergen, Norway. My dissertation focuses on the stability of pre-electoral coalitions in Latin America, with a broader interest in party systems, executive studies (Vice Presidents), executive-legislative relations, and most recently youth representation.

I’m fluent in Spanish, English, and French, and I thrive on exploring both political puzzles and fictional worlds. I’m especially fond of romantic, classic, and mystery novels — stories that remind us how messy and beautiful human choices can be.

Outside of academia, you’ll probably find me bouldering or training at the gym (or simply saying I do both).

Feel free to reach out — whether for research collaboration, academic chatting, or just for a normal conversation :)
